# Silent Treatment 

Okay, so the issue with my previous project ([FeelingFine](https://github.com/sp1d5r/FeelingFine)) was that the training 
and testing data set wasn't exactly the best, and not only that but we also where using perfect audio files. The only 
reasonable next step seems to be doing extra data preprocessing on the inputs that we get and also filter out any strange 
background noise. I think it makes sense to work on some noise suppression software on movie scripts to extract the voices.

So that's what this repository is about...

Me learning how to do that.

Okay, Enjoy!
